[Koshkil Framework](https://koshkil.danielmarjos.com) is a rapid development framework for PHP which
uses commonly known design patterns like Associative Data
Mapping, Front Controller, and MVC.  Our primary goal is to provide a structured
framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web
applications, without any loss to flexibility.

## Installing Koshkil via Composer

You can install Koshkil Network clients into your project using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org).  If you're starting a new project, we
recommend using the app skeleton as a starting point. 
For existing applications you can run the following:

``` bash
$ composer require koshkil/network
